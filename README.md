# Biochar Yield and Composition Prediction System: A Machine Learning Approachm ðŸªµðŸ”¥

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a Biochar Yield and Composition Prediction System using machine learning techniques. Biochar production through pyrolysis of organic waste offers a sustainable approach to reducing dependence on conventional energy sources and mitigating global warming. To address the challenges posed by existing prediction modelsâ€”such as computational inefficiency, complexity, and limited accuracy for unseen scenario. This project utilizes advanced machine learning models trained on feedstock compositions and pyrolysis process conditions.
